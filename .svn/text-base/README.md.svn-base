IMPReSS OWL
===========

This project uses the [OWLAPI](http://owlapi.sourceforge.net) library to
generate an ontology of the individuals in the IMPReSS database. The current
ontology can be viewed online by going to
<http://www.mousephenotype.org/impress/ontology/impress-ontology>. This project
is a part of the [IMPReSS](https://github.com/mpi2/impress) application.

The IMPReSS ontology relies on an abstract ontology called the High-Throughput 
Phenotyping Ontology which was developed separately in
[Protégé](http://protege.stanford.edu). It is hoped this ontology is useful
outside the scope of the IMPC Project. You can view it online by going to
<http://www.mousephenotype.org/impress/ontology/high-throughput-phenotyping>.

The way the IMPReSS ontology works is by importing and using the classes of the
High-Throughput Phenotyping ontology and adding a few ontology classes of it's
own. It then creates individuals and object properties to connect items together.
The final output of the application is a ~40MB OWL ontology file.
